We present a soft-surfaced, vision-based tactile foot sensor that endows a bipedal robot with a skin-like deformable layer capturing contact deformations optically. From a contact image stream, our method estimates contact pose, visualizes shear, computes center of pressure (CoP), classifies terrain, and detects geometric features. We validate these capabilities on a tilting platform and in visually obscured conditions, showing that foot-borne tactile feedback improves balance control and terrain awareness beyond proprioception alone.
