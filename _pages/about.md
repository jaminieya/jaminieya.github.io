I am an M.S. student at the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University, advised by Prof. Ahmed H. Qureshi. Previously, I received Bachelor's in Computer Science at Purdue University, where I worked with Prof. Yu She and Prof. Timothy Reese.

I'm interested in robot learning, especially in the areas of generalizable manipulation policies and robot tool use. Eventually, I want to push the frontier of what AI can accomplish in the physical world.
